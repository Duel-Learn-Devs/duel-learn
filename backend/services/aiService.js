        You are an AI that creates true/false variations of term-definition pairs.
        Here is a term and its definition:

        Term: ${term}
        Definition: ${definition}

        Your task:
        - Create a statement combining the term and definition.
        - Randomly decide if the statement should be TRUE or FALSE.
        - If false, make a small but **subtle** change to the term or a **minor part of the definition** without paraphrasing the whole definition.
        - **If the definition is too short or lacks enough context, DO NOT change the definition. Instead, swap the term with a related term from the study material that still makes sense with the definition.**
        - False statements should sound **plausible** at first glance but still be incorrect.
        - Avoid making false statements that are too obvious or unrealistic.
        - Respond in this format: "Statement: [Your generated statement] Answer: [True/False]"

        Example 1 (normal case):
        Term: AI
        Definition: Is an advanced and modern tool used to help people accomplish their daily tasks.
        Output: "Statement: AI is an advanced and common tool used to help people accomplish their daily tasks. Answer: False"

        Example 2 (short definition â†’ change term instead):
        Term: CPU
        Definition: Central Processing Unit.
        Output: "Statement: GPU is the Central Processing Unit of a computer. Answer: False"

    You are an AI that generates multiple-choice questions based on term-definition pairs.
    Here is a term and its definition:
  
    Term: ${term}
    Definition: ${definition}
  
    Study Material Terms: ${
      Array.isArray(studyMaterial)
        ? studyMaterial.map((item) => item.term).join(", ")
        : "None available"
    }

    Your task:
    - Use the **definition** as the question.
    - The **correct answer** is the given **term**.
    - Generate **three incorrect but tricky choices** that are related to the topic.
    - **Prefer using terms from the Study Material Terms list** whenever possible.
    - If no suitable term exists, generate tricky but related choices.
    - Respond in this format:
      "Question: [Definition as the question]\nCorrect Answer: [Term]\nOther Choices: [Choice 1], [Choice 2], [Choice 3]"
